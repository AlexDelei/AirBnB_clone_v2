#### How to build a web framework with Flask
<li>Define Project Structure:
	Organize your project structure in a way that makes sense for a web framework. This typically includes directories for routes, templates, static files, and possibly extensions or utilities.
</li>
<li>Create a Base Application Factory:
	 Define a function to create a Flask application instance.
</li>
<li>Define Routes:
	Create modules to define routes for different parts of your application.
</li>
<li>Create Templates:
	Define HTML templates for rendering dynamic content. Flask uses Jinja2 as its template engine, so you'll write templates using Jinja2 syntax.
</li>
<li>Add Middleware and Extensions:
	 Incorporate middleware or Flask extensions to enhance functionality. Examples include Flask-WTF for form handling, Flask-SQLAlchemy for database integration, and Flask-Login for user authentication.
